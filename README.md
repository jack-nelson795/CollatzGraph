# Collatz Conjecture Visualizer

This Python script visualizes the Collatz conjecture sequences for a range of starting integers using matplotlib. The Collatz conjecture, is a famous unsolved mathematical problem where, for any positive integer n, the sequence follows the rule:
- If n is even, divide it by 2.
- If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

## Features

- **Collatz Sequence Generation**: Generate the Collatz sequence from 1 to any given integer.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Plot and visualize the sequences for a range of numbers using a logarithmic scale.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:
- matplotlib
- math

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
